Make sure you have NodeJS and npm installed on your system. Check with "node -v" and "npm -v".

Install MySQL standalone server or with MySQL Workbench. If you don't have it already, make sure that during the installation the root password is 'admin'. If you have sql installed and the root password is different:

In CMD:
1. 'cd C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin'
2. 'mysql -u root -p' (enter current password)
3. while in 'mysql>' paste and run "ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'admin';", then run 'FLUSH PRIVILEGES;', and finally 'EXIT;'


Now to test our website:

4. cd into this project folder
5. Run 'npm install mysql' in this directory (make sure you have npm command installed)
6. run 'node setupDatabase.js' once
Then everytime to view the website:
7. run 'node server.js'
8. In your browser, go to "http://localhost:3000"
...
(if you set password as 'admin' during MySQL installation you can skip steps 1-3, but if you get an error when running 'node server.js' then try steps 1-3 as well.)
